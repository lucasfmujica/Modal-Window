# Modal Window Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a simple modal window implementation in a webpage. The modal window can be triggered by three different buttons, each labeled "Show modal 1", "Show modal 2", and "Show modal 3". Once opened, the modal window displays a title and a paragraph of text. 

The modal window can be closed in one of three ways:

- By clicking the close button (represented by 'Ã—') in the modal window.
- By clicking anywhere outside the modal window on the overlay.
- By pressing the 'Escape' key on the keyboard.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Files in the Repository

The repository contains the following files:

1. An HTML file (`index.html`): This file contains the structure of the webpage including the modal window and its triggering buttons.

2. A CSS file (`style.css`): This file contains styles for the webpage and the modal window.

3. A JavaScript file (`script.js`): This file contains the functionality for opening and closing the modal window, including the event listeners for the buttons and the 'Escape' key.

## Running the Project

To run this project, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in a web browser. Clicking any of the "Show modal" buttons will open the modal window. Try closing it using one of the three methods mentioned above.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a simple example of how to implement a modal window on a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It covers basic DOM manipulation in JavaScript as well as handling of events like button clicks and keyboard presses.
